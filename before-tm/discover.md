# The Tower
You cross the street, and just as you start to enter the alley some BUTTHEAD running out knocks into you and knocks your glasses off!!
Automatically due to your extreme blindless without them, you fratically search for them on the ground around you. Finally putting them on you find no trace of the stranger but instead discover the source of the light...   
A huge, alien-looking, glowing tower standing in the middle of this alley. It looks as if it was made for someone to stand inside...  
Should you go inside?

[Duh! Of course I should head in!](../situations/time-machine.md)
