Guess that time machine was just a waste-of-time... machine.  You step out of the time machine and look back at the glowing tower one more time as you think about how you just wasted five minutes of your life...   
At this point you don't even bother checking the time since you probably are going to be late anyways. You just start to rush out the alley as you bump into someone heading in, knocking over their glasses and marking the second accident of the day. As they scramble to find their glasses, you begin to help them until you realize... That stranger before you... is no stranger at all... ITS YOU!!  
THE TIME MACHINE WORKED!!  
but wait... what now?? Isn't this EXACTLY what every time-travelling movie tells you not to do??
