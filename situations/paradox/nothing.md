# Nothing happened?
---
When you press the button, you feel startled as the doors instantly close. You try prying them open but stop at the sound of a buzzer. A red light goes off on the monitor and you feel a prolonged rumble until the light suddenly turns green and shuts off. There is dead silence till you jump once again at the sound of the doors, now opening. Beyond the doors you see the same alley that you entered from and notice seemingly no change. Did it work? Is this thing broken?   
maybe you should try again?    
[Nah this thing is broken. I got classes to go to](leave-tm.md)  
[Ehhhhh I'll try again](../time-machine.md)
