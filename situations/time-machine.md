# THE TIME MACHINE 
--- 
You decide to step inside the thing and there on the monitor, you read `temporal travelling device v-3.4`   
Oh my gosh, *ITS A TIME MACHINE!!!*
Your eyes light up as you think of all the things you can do with it! You just can't WAIT to get started. You then look around and see 3 presets of times to travel to.
